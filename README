The big messup of Summer 2016: If a file is not being removed
when it should've been removed, then it's an issue with tracking 
post-deletion. One should enter the command:
	git rm --cached <filename>

To create a base folder, use <base href="url">. Any file under it can then 
be accessed as if we were in root
