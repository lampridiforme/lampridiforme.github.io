            <p> 
It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
<br>
The regular crowd shuffles in
<br>
There's an old man sitting next to me
<br>
Making love to his tonic and gin
<br>
<br>
He says, "Son can you play me a memory
<br>
I'm not really sure how it goes
<br>
But it's sad and it's sweet
<br>
And I knew it complete
<br>
When I wore a younger man's clothes."
<br>
<br>
Sing us a song you're the piano man
<br>
Sing us a song tonight
<br>
Well we're all in the mood for a melody
<br>
And you've got us feeling alright
<br>
<br>
Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
<br>
He gets me my drinks for free
<br>
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
<br>
But there's someplace that he'd rather be
<br>
<br>
He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me."
<br>
As a smile ran away from his face
<br>
"Well, I'm sure that I could be a movie star
<br>
If I could get out of this place."
<br>
<br>
Now Paul is a real estate novelist
<br>
Who never had time for a wife
<br>
And he's talking with Davy, who's still in the Navy
<br>
And probably will be for life
<br>
<br>
And the waitress is practicing politics
<br>
As the businessmen slowly get stoned
<br>
Yes they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
<br>
But it's better than drinking alone
<br>
<br>
Sing us a song you're the piano man
<br>
Sing us a song tonight
<br>
Well we're all in the mood for a melody
<br>
And you've got us feeling alright
<br>
<br>
It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
<br>
And the manager gives me a smile
<br>
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been coming to see
<br>
To forget about life for a while
<br>
<br>
And the piano it sounds like a carnival
<br>
And the microphone smells like a beer
<br>
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
<br>
And say, "Man what are you doing here?"
<br>
<br>
Sing us a song you're the piano man
<br>
Sing us a song tonight
<br>
Well we're all in the mood for a melody
<br>
And you've got us feeling alright
